### About
This project is a recreation of the original 2 lane attack/defend Minecraft PvP map by MrScaryMuffin and T3hMuffinz. Level design changes, tech modernization, and gameplay tweaks are included. Adversity was initially developed as a 2v2 take on the map Calamity.

### Building
The ```dev``` branch is updated with every change and is generally in a state that is not playable. This branch contains tags referencing specific commits of playtest versions and are configured to be functional. It is recommended that, if wanting to play, you checkout one of the tags.

Using Git:
1. ```git clone https://github.com/notjeven/adversity.git```
2. ```cd adversity```
3. ```git checkout <latest tag>``` 

Without Git:
1. navigate to [releases](https://github.com/notjeven/adversity/releases)
2. download the ```.zip``` or ```.tar``` archive of the latest release
3. extract your downloaded archive
