### About
This project is a recreation of the original 2 lane attack/defend Minecraft PvP map by MrScaryMuffin and T3hMuffinz. Level design changes, tech modernization, and gameplay tweaks are included. Adversity was initially developed as a 2v2 take on the map Calamity.

### Building
The ```level``` branch can be directly cloned as a save folder.

The ```dev``` branch can be directly cloned as the datapack in ```../saves/adversity/datapacks/<cloned dev branch>```
